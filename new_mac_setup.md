# Setting up a new Mac

## Steps

- Download and install iTerm2 [1]. (This app has better support for tmux compared to MacOS's built in Terminal.)
- Update iTerm preferences
  - Go to Profile -> Colors. Select the preset of "Solarized Dark"
  - Go to Profile -> Text. Increase the font size to 16.
  - Go to General -> Select. Check "Applications in Terminal may access clipboard". This is needed to copy from tmux and paste into other Mac OS apps.
